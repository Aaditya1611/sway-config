**You need to install the following packages in order to use this config**


You can find most of them on AUR, if you use a different distro than Arch linux, find these packages in your distro repository

Replace yay with your favourite AUR helper

```bash
yay -S Nordic-darker alacritty wofi chromium polkit-gnome waybar blueman wlroots-nvidia wlogout
```
Some of them can be installed through pacman

```bash
sudo pacman -S noto-fonts htop blueman-manager xdg-desktop-portal ddcutil
```

**Note:- **
Make a folder in /home/$USER/Pictures with this name "Wallpapers" and copy the image in the repo into this directory

**Also go through the workspace and display section to set your own custom bindings**
